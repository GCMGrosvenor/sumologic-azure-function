# Version increment mode
# - GitVersion default mode for all branches but develop is ContinuousDelivery.
#   + In ContinuousDelivery, each checkin is a release candidate, so semver stays static (save for BuildMetadata field - e.g. the 3 in 1.2.0-feature1.0+3) and semver increments only after a release is tagged (see https://gitversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/continuous-delivery/)
#   + In ContinuousDeployment, because each checkin passing tests is deployed, the semver is incremented with each commit (e.g. the 3 in 1.2.0-feature1.3) (see https://gitversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/continuous-deployment/)
# - We want to tag each checkin that passes tests with , we have to keep the mode ContinuousDeployment, or else any checkin after a tag will get incremented
